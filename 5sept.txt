Create the below classes and then create an object to demonstrate all the methods of their respective class. 

Q1) Write a Java program to create a class called "BankAccount" with attributes for account number, account holder's name, and balance. Include methods for depositing and withdrawing money, as well as checking the balance.
Use a constructor for setting the account number, account holder's name and balance to zero.

Q3) Define a class CARRENTAL with the following details :

    Class attributes : CarId of int type, CarType of string type. 
    Define a constructor that sets the values of class attributes. eg: CarId="HR45AB4525", CarType="Fortuner"
    Define GetCar() method which returns CarId and CarType.
    GetRent() method which return rent of the car on the basis of car type, i.e. Small Car = 1000, Van = 800, SUV = 2500. Use switch-case construct.

    Class attributes : empno of type integer, ename of type String, basic, hr and da are of type float, netpay of type float.
    Define a constructor that sets the default values of class attributes. String variables are set to null and numerical variables are set to 0. 
    Methods :
    Calculate() : A function to find basic+hra+da with the float return type.
    havedata() : function to accept values for empno, ename, basic, hra, da as parameters and invoke calculate() to calculate netpay.
    dispdata() : function to display all the class attributes.
